# Enchancing-the-Accuracy-of-ML-and-DL-Models-in-Phishing-Detection
Classfication of URL using Machine learning and Deep learning

Objective:
Phishing is an online attack used by perpetrators in committing frauds through social engineering schemes via SMS, Mails, Online Adverts to lure the users to Phishing Websites which is similar to legitimate URL’S to gain confidential information about victim’s personal identity, financial details and User Id’s and credentials.

A variety of benign, spam, phishing, malware, and defacement URLs are included in this website. Then I've selected the file All.Csv Dataset and filtered 7586 Phishing & 7781 Benign URLs is taken into consideration as a dataset to train the ML & DL models.
